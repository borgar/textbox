<p>What makes the Gutenberg Bible the unattain~able mas~ter~piece of the art of print~ing? The print~ing on his hand~press? Can't be re~al~ly, be~cause of to~day's stan~dards, the ink~ing was not of ex~tra~or~di~nary qual~ity. We could or~der hand made rag pa~per al~so in out day. Maybe the se~cret of his beau~ti~ful pages is in the pro~por~tions of the columns on the pa~per. But this we are al~so able to copy. There~fore on~ly the com~po~si~tion is to be con~sid~ered close~ly.</p>

<p>How could Guten~berg get those even gray ar~eas of columns with~out dis~turb~ing or un~sight~ly holes be~tween words? His se~cret: the mas~ter achieved this per~fec~tion by ap~ply~ing sev~er~al char~ac~ters of dif~fer~ent width com~bined with many lig~a~tures and ab~bre~vi~a~tions out of his type case. He fi~nal~ly cre~at~ed 290 char~ac~ters for the com~po~si~tion of the 42-line Bible. An enor~mous time con~sum~ing job to re~al~ize his idea of good ty~po~graph~ic lines: the jus~ti~fied lines of even length, com~pared to the flush-left lines of the works of the fa~mous me~di~ae~val scribes.

<p>But with Jo~hannes Guten~berg's un~usu~al lig~a~tures and ab~bre~vi~a~tions, to~day we can't ap~ply this old prin~ci~ple for con~tem~po~rary com~po~si~tion. Now we can get help through the ver~sa~til~i~ty of mod~ern elec~tron~ic soft~ware and for~mats like the Mul~ti~ple Mas~ters to re~ceive a per~fect type set~ting in our pro~duc~tion, to achieve Guten~berg's stan~dards of qual~i~ty: Textbox li~brary.
